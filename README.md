# The Weekend Out

Imagine this: A group of friends, tired from their busy university schedules, decides to take a much-needed break.
They plan a weekend getaway to the mountains, where they can relax, hike, and enjoy nature. 
To make sure they don’t forget anything important, they create a shared packing list in a Git repository called “Weekend Out.”

Each friend has their own ideas about what to bring.
Alex thinks they need extra blankets for the chilly nights, while Jamie insists on packing a portable grill for a barbecue. 
Taylor, the group’s tech enthusiast, wants to bring a drone to capture stunning aerial shots of their adventure.

To keep things organized, they decide to use Git to manage their packing list. 
They create branches for different categories of items: `feature/blankets`, `feature/grill`, and `feature/drone`. 
Each friend adds their items to the list and commits their changes.

However, as they merge their branches into the main list, they encounter a problem: merge conflicts! 
Alex and Jamie both added items to the same line in the `packing_list.txt` file. 
Now, they need to resolve these conflicts to ensure everyone’s items are included.

Thanks god they have learned about Git and how to resolve conflicts through the following exercises:
